# User Experience (UX)

## Site Structure

Dublin Minds' website has four pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [techniques](tech.html), [bookings](book.html) and [contact us](contact.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another link to the bookings page in the 'book a session' section to some navigational flexibility to the site visitor.

## Design Choices

* ### Typography
      The fonts selected are 'Ubuntu' for the headings and 'Nunito' for the body text. Each fall back to sans-serif. 
     *  'Ubuntu' was chosen for the headings due to it's subtle boldness and to give the user an calming welcoming feel.
      * 'Nunito' is used for the body text as it provides a nice calming and inviting feel whilst being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The chosen colour scheme is based on blue. The colour palette applied globally to the website was derived from the colour of the hero image. The colour Blue is calmimg and goes well with the overall theme of the website, given that Dublin Minds promotes mindfulness and wellbeing as an experience it hopes it's users and site visitors will avail of.

# Acknowledgements
The website was completed as a Portfolio 1 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). It has been an educational experience, I would, therefore, like to thank my family, my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://www.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168/), the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help, support and patience throughout this journey. Dublin Minds is a fictional company, although being mindful and living in the moment is an exploratory pastime for the author.
