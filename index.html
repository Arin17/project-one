        <h3>The Seven Pillars of Mindfulness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-judging.
                <li>The world isn't black and white. However, many of us see judgments as just that. Something is either 
                good or bad; this automatic judgment takes over and informs your choices in ways that you may not even 
                realize. It is critical that you find awareness. Not action, but awareness. You must be able to recognize 
                the judgments you automatically make so you can begin to work around them.</li>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Patience.
                <li>
                    As the saying goes, patience is a virtue. The same point is made in the principles of mindfulness. You 
                    must understand that the events of your life will unfold in time and accept that. There is no need to 
                    rush. You should live the moment for what it is and not become too transfixed on the future.
                </li>
            </li> 
            <br>
            <li>Beginner's Mind.
                <li>
                    It's easy to lose yourself if you begin to believe that you have heard, seen and experienced everything. 
                    This principle brings forward the idea that life is ever changing. No moment is the same as another. Each 
                    one is unique in nature and contains unique possibilities. The beginner’s mind reminds us of this 
                    simplicity. The focus here is to not let your experiences become filtered by what you believe you already 
                    know.
                </li>
            </li>            
            <br>
            <li>Trust.
                <li>
                    Having trust in yourself, your beliefs and your intuition is necessary to find peace. Being your own 
                    person and letting your ideals guide you are the only way to be sure that you are on the right path. You 
                    should be open to learning and be listening, but ultimately know that the choices you make should be 
                    decided based on what you think and believe.                    
                </li>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Non-Striving.
                <li>
                    Being and trusting yourself is crucial within the principles of mindfulness. Non-striving is the practice 
                    of recognizing that who you are is enough and that striving to be “different” or “better” can be distracting. 
                    Embrace who you are and find comfort in that. This allows you to concentrate on the things that matter in 
                    the present moment.
                </li>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Acceptance.
                <li>
                    Acceptance can sometimes be misconstrued. This principle is not about being complacent and choosing to be 
                    content with things you may not like. Instead, the idea is that you learn to accept the way that things 
                    really are. Don't be clouded by your biases. Instead, you should learn to see the facts within our world 
                    and accept them as they are.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Letting Go.
                <li>
                    Letting go…it seems simple enough, doesn’t it? The truth is that relaxing can be difficult when naturally 
                    people become fixated on their own thoughts and ideas. It elevates stress and doesn’t allow us to really 
                    focus on what matters. To be mindful, you need to be able to free ourselves of worry and focus on the 
                    present.

        <h3>What is Mindfulness</h3>      
        <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and 
            feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, 
            guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts 
            can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression.  
            Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage 
            with the world around you.
